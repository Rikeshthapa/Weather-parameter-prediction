Weather Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and data used for weather prediction analysis. The primary goal of this project is to predict weather conditions using machine learning models and statistical techniques based on historical data.

Project Structure

	•	weather.csv.gz: Compressed CSV file containing the weather dataset used in the project. This dataset includes historical weather observations, which will be used to train and validate the prediction models.
	•	weatherprediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for preprocessing the data, building the prediction model, and visualizing the results. The notebook uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data handling and model training.

Features

	•	Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for model training.
	•	Model Training: Implements different machine learning algorithms for weather prediction.
	•	Model Evaluation: Compares the accuracy and performance of different models.
	•	Visualization: Provides graphical insights into data trends and prediction results.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Libraries:
	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	scikit-learn
	•	matplotlib

Future Work

	•	Implement additional machine learning models for improved prediction accuracy.
	•	Explore hyperparameter tuning and feature selection techniques.
	•	Extend the project to include real-time weather data from an API.
